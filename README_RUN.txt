AC Pay Calculator — PWA (v1.8, CSP-safe)
===========================================

**If buttons/tabs do nothing**, you are likely opening the file inside a preview
that blocks JavaScript (common on iPhone Files / cloud viewers). Use one of these:

Option A — Quick local server on a Mac
--------------------------------------
1) Double-click `serve.command`
2) In Safari on your iPhone or Mac, go to:  http://localhost:8000
3) Tap **Share → Add to Home Screen**

Option B — Host on GitHub Pages or Netlify
------------------------------------------
1) Upload the contents of this folder to a static host.
2) Open the site in Safari on iPhone → **Share → Add to Home Screen**

Notes
-----
- Defaults: FO · A320 · 2025 · MB · 80 hrs; ESOP 10% (cap $30,000).
- VO tab default Credit = 10. Result = (Credit*2) hours at calculated hourly, net at marginal rates.
- Tie Year/Step & XLR toggles are on both tabs; A320 XLR adds $2.46/hr except FO step 1/2.
- 2025 federal/prov taxes implemented; CPP/QPP/EI as documented earlier.
